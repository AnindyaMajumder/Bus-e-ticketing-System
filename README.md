# Bus E-Ticketing System

The **Bus E-Ticketing System** is a web-based application that simplifies bus ticket booking by digitizing the process, making public transportation more accessible and efficient. Passengers can reserve seats online, while administrators can manage fleet schedules and seat availability in real-time.
